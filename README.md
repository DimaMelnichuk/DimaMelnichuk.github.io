### Hi , my name is 
# [Dmitriy Melnichuk](https://dimamelnichuk.github.io/ "Portfolio")

I build things for the web.  
I am currently based in Ukraine and enjoy building things that live on the internet.

I love learning new and better ways to create seamless user experiences with clean, efficient, and scalable code. I consider work an ongoing education, and I'm always looking for opportunities to work with those who are willing to share their knowledge as much as I want to learn.

## Some technologies I've worked with:

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JQuery
* SASS/SCSS
* BEM
* Gulp
* Git

## I believe anything can be overcome commitment and hard work. Always up for learning new things.
